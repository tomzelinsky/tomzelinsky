# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom – the guy with the camera

📍 Based in Cardiff, South Wales  
📸 I photograph weddings that feel more like stories than photoshoots  
🎪 From tiny pub elopements to festival fields – I’m in, as long as it’s real

## 🤓 What I Do

I'm a documentary wedding photographer.  
I shoot the messy hugs, the nervous giggles, and the chaotic group photos where someone always blinks.  
No posing. No cheese. Just honest storytelling.
